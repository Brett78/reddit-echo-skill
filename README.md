## Reddit Echo Skill
A very basic Amazon Echo skill that lists the top 5 Reddit posts by default from the front page or the top 5 posts
from a specific sub-reddit.

This skill was/is uploaded as a lambda function which requires a very flat file structure including dependencies that
have been installed via pip.
